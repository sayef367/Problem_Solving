// - Louise and Richard have developed a numbers game. They pick a number (1 â‰¤ n < 264) and check to see if it is a power of 2. If it is, they divide it by 2. If not, they reduce it by the next lower number which is a power of 2. Whoever reduces the number to 1 wins the game. Louise always starts.
// - Given an initial value, determine who wins the game.
// - As an example, let the initial value n = 132. It's Louise's turn so she first determines that 132 is not a power of 2. The next lower power of is 128, so she subtracts that from 132 and passes 4 to Richard. 4 is a power of 2, so Richard divides it by 2 and passes 2 to Louise. Likewise, 2 is a power so she divides it by 2 and reaches 1. She wins the game.
// - If they initially set counter to 1, Richard wins. Louise cannot make a move so she loses.
// input 132
// output Louise
